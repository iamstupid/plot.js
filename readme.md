#plot.js
#introduction
`Plot.js` is a simple and lightweight `JavaScript` plotting library implements with `<canvas>`.It is able to work in any modern browsers.

A few external libraries are included and some of `plot.js` functionals are implemented with API in them. These external libraries are listing above:

 - **`Tcanvas.js`**
 - **`kernal.js`**
 - **`exmath.js`**

These libraries will be discribed to show its usage below:
> **Tcanvas.js**
> > A simple canvas library to manage canvases and deal with cache, sub-pixel 
> > antialias for you.
> > 
> > **Including:** `bezier.js` and `CSA.js`*(canvas Subpixel Antialias)* 
> > converting to Tcanvas format.   
> > **Dependence:** Fully independent.   
> > **Work with:** HTML5 `canvas`.
> 
> **kernal.js**
> > A simple Web-workers wrapper to do parallel computing. Wr=ork well with 
> > `exmath.js`.
> > 
> > **Including:** None.   
> > **Dependence:** Fully independent. But to work with, you need to include 
> > a library to do calculating.   
> > **Work with:** `Web Workers`.
> 
> **exmath.js**
> > Extended methods of the native `Math` library. Works with Complex, vectors 
> > and matrixes. External functions like Gamma(/,L,Di),Zeta(Some) and more.
> > 
> > **Including:** Part of `stats.js`.
> > **Dependence:** Fully independent.
> > **Work with:** None.
